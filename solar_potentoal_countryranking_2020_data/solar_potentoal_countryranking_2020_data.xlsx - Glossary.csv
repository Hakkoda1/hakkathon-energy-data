,Theoretical PV Potential
,"Global horizontal irradiance, the longterm amount of solar resource available on a horizontal surface on Earth, measured in kWh/m2/day. It is the sum of direct (DNI) and diffuse (DIF) components."
,
,Practical PV Potential
,"Photovoltaic power output of a PV system (specific yield); in this case, the longterm power ouput produced by a utility-scale installation of monofacial modules fixed mounted at an optimum tilt, measured in kWh/kWp/day"
, • Level 0 - Practical potential disregarding any land-use constraints 
," • Level 1 - Level 0 practical potential, excluding land with identifiable physical obstacles to utility-scale pv plants"
," • Level 2 - Level 1 practical potential, excluding land possibly under land use regulations due to nature and      cropland protection"
,
,Economic PV Potential 
,"Levelized cost of electricity - the lifetime costs associated with construction and operation of the power plant divided by the electricity produced during this lifetime, measured in USD/kWh (the lower the cost, the higher is the economic potential)"
,
,PV equivalent area
,"Presumed country area proportion to be covered by PV plants producing the equivalent of yearly electricity consumption. The calculation assumes fixed-mounted, monofacial C-Si modules with optimum tilt and row spacing. The estimated area includes both the active area of PV modules and the area between the module rows."
,
,PV seasonality index 
,Ratio between the highest and the lowest of monthly long-term PVOUT averages
